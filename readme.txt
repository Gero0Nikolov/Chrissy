This plugin will add a speech recognition navigation to your front-end website.

== Description ==
Chrissy will make your website more interactive!

She will provide your visitors with the ability to just mention the name of the page which they want to visit from the menu and she'll bring them there.
<strong>Example:</strong> Go to Blog

Using the Google Speech Recognition API to catch precisely the User Voice Input, Chrissy is the first Voice Driven Navigagor in the WordPress world!

Of course she knows that not all of the browsers support the Speech Recognition API, so she'll relieve her self only to visitors who are using Chrome and Chrome on Android.

And since Chrissy is one great thing, I would like to tell you that you can join the contribution and make it greater with your ideas using the link from bellow ⬇️
